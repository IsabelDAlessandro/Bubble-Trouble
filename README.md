# Bubble-Trouble
 Based on the popular board game Trouble, Bubble Trouble allows up to four players to play an ocean-themed version of the game through an interactive GUI. Developed for Wellesley's CS 230 Data Structures course in collaboration with Michelle Quin and Leslie Gates. 
 

Instructions 
The goal of the game is to be the first player to move all four of their fish from Home to Finish. A label at the top of the game board will indicate which player’s turn it is, and what action" they need to take.To roll, click the die at the center of the game board. You are only allowed to move your fish out of Homeif you roll a 6 or a 1. Once your fish are on the board, roll the die and click the fish that you want to move.<br> You will be moved the corresponding number of spots. If you land on a space that has your opponent’s fish<br>, your opponent’s fish is sent back to their Home.You may not land on your own fish. After swimming around the board once, your fish can make their way into their finish zone. The first player to have all 4 of their fish in the finish zone is the winner!

GUI:
-There will be 3 tabs in the GUI: Instructions, Setup, and Game:
-The instructions pane will have all of the instructions needed to play the game and a
picture of the game board.
-The setup pane will allow players to pick their game pieces and their name. A Player will enter their name in the text field next to the color/icon that they would like to be in the game. If there are fewer than 2 players’ names entered, they will automatically play a computer player.
- The Game tab is where the actual game will be played. On the top of the Game tab is a label indicating which Player’s turn it is, and what action they need to take(roll, move, etc.). To the right of the game board will be a panel displaying which Player is currently winning. The game starts by clicking on the play button in the upper left corner. Once that button is clicked, the first player will be prompted to roll the die by clicking on the die icon in the center of the board. The leaderboard will also be initialized at this point. After rolling, the number that was rolled will be displayed in the upper right corner. It will then prompt the next player to roll if the current player cannot make any moves or will prompt the current player to select a pawn to move.
